This project is a modular, multipurpose drone platform designed around a standardized bottom-mounted payload interface. Instead of building separate drones for different tasks, the same airframe can quickly swap payloads such as LiDAR, cameras, or agricultural systems with minimal mechanical and electrical changes. Each payload follows a common mounting and connector standard, allowing the drone to adapt to different missions while keeping the core flight system unchanged. The goal is to make drone development more flexible, scalable, and practical for real-world applications.
